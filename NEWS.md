# mipdeval (development version)

* Added `accuracy()` statistic for calculating the proportion of predicted drug concentrations that fall within specified absolute and relative error margins. This statistic will only be calculated in `run_eval()` when the absolute and relative error margins have been specified in the `.stats_summ_options` argument (see `stats_summ_options()`). (#30)

# mipdeval 0.1.0

* Initial version.
