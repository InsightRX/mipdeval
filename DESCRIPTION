Description: The package provides functionality to run through a
  NONMEM-style dataset iteratively, performing MAP Bayesian updating
  and forecasting at each step. This is very much like the `proseval` 
  tool in PsN, however this package provides more options, 
  specifically for use in MIPD, such as flattening priors, 
  time-based weighting, sample grouping, etc.
